## My Projects

Here is a list of projects I am working on.

### rsk.ee

`rsk.ee` is a simple web service that identifies and displays the source IP address of the connecting client. It is built as a lightweight, serverless application running on Google Cloud Functions (GCP). You can visit the service here: https://rsk.ee.
